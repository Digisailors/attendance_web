  # Fix Team Members Relationships

  1. Fix Foreign Key Constraints
    - Ensure proper foreign key relationships are established
    - Fix the team_lead_id reference to use the correct column

  2. Security
    - Update RLS policies to be more permissive for debugging
    - Ensure all operations are allowed

  3. Data Integrity
    - Add proper constraints and indexes
    - Ensure referential integrity
